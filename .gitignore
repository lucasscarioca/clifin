#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

# Visual Studio Code
#   Visual Studio Code specific template is maintained in a separate VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#   that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#   and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer,
#   you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
